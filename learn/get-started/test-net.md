title: Test Net
---

We have set up a small test Stellar network. When developing please feel free to use it. We run 3 stellar-core validators on this test network. You can set your stellar-core to connect to us by using this [configuration](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-core/blob/master/docs/stellar-core_testnet.cfg).

We also have a Horizon instance that is connected to the testnet: [https://horizon-testnet.stellar.org/](https://horizon-testnet.stellar.org/).

The test net will be reset every once in a while so don't get attached to your balances or accounts on there.
