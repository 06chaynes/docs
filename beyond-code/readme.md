# Contribute
We value contributions of all types to Stellar. If you're new to open source or financial technology, or simply have strengths that don't involve code, here are some ways to get involved:
* Q&A
* Host or attend a meetup
* Create a tutorial
* Give a talk
* Write documentation


## Q&A

Lots of people have Q's about Stellar—maybe you have A's.

* Join the conversation on [Slack](http://slack.stellar.org/).
* Post code snippets and answer questions on [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com). Or ask your own.


## Host or attend a meetup
Stellar hosts [meetups in SF](http://www.meetup.com/Stellar-SF/). If you’d like to host your own, we’re happy to help promote the event and connect you to other interested people. Reach out to us on [Slack](http://slack.stellar.org/) for more info.


## Create a tutorial
The best way to learn something is to teach it to someone else. If you're curious about how something works, it’s likely others are, too. A few ideas for tutorials:

* Blog posts about what you made
* Screencasts of your experience

Let us know what you’ve produced, and we'll include it where appropriate.


## Give a talk
We warmly welcome you to speak about Stellar at a conference or meetup. Some resources:

* [Examples of talks](https://www.stellar.org/blog/tag/stellar-talks/) given by the
Stellar.org team
* Stellar's [blank slide template](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1C9493Vj1J0JzbiMiEOn64NWdfBl3Kal2KverZWSVziw/edit#slide=id.g6db1791cd_022) for you to use


## Write documentation
Good documentation makes Stellar more accessible, and we can always use more eyes on our docs. We'd love to hear about what's confusing or where you get stuck.

Even better, you can contribute improvements or additions to our existing documentation. Ideas for additions:

* Relevant diagrams, screenshots, or images
* Examples and code snippets

We use GitHub to track documentation contributions. If you're new to GitHub, we recommend the GitHub Guide on [Contributing to Open Source](https://guides.github.com/activities/contributing-to-open-source/). To submit a docs improvement, see the section on pull requests in our [code contribution guide](https://github.com/stellar/docs/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).
