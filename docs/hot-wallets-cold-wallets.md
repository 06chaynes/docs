## Hot Wallets and Cold Wallets
A Gateway’s issuing address (or rather, the corresponding secret key) is like a printing press for its issued credits (or in the poker chip analogy, the machine that makes a casino’s poker chips): if it’s compromised, the effects can be devastating. If an attacker compromises the issuing account’s secret key, they can issue unlimited credit at will, making any existing credits worthless because now the Gateway cannot cover withdrawals as it no longer has 1:1 parity between its reserves and its credits on the network. Additionally, the issuing account’s address can no longer be used as it is compromised (in our analogy, the casino will need to make completely new poker chips, with different security features). This is a worst case scenario for a Gateway and it’s crucial to take steps to ensure this will never happen.

For these reasons, it is recommended that the Gateway’s issuing account be a “cold wallet,” meaning its secret key is stored in an offline machine not connected to the public internet. This is referred to as “cold storage”. Creating a transaction from the issuing account cold wallet should require manual, human action, and signing should be done locally on the offline machine. To introduce a transaction to the network, the signed transaction binary should be moved from the cold machine to an internet connected machine via usb drive or some other manual process. In contrast, a “hot wallet” is a Stellar account whose keys are stored on a machine connected to the internet, and are therefore vulnerable to a remote attack. Automated transactions are done using a “hot wallet”.

Obviously a Gateway will need to automatically issue credits in response to customer requests for withdrawal. The recommended practice is to create a “hot wallet” Stellar account which trusts the Gateway’s issuing account. Create a cold wallet transaction that sends a certain amount of credit from the cold wallet to the hot wallet (as much credit as the Gateway can afford to lose) and send it to the network. Now, the hot wallet is funded with a small amount and can pay credit to user’s automatically (as both the hot wallet and the customer’s account trust the issuing account).
