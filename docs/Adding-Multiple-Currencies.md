Adding multiple currencies on Stellar
=======================================

* To add balances in other currencies on Stellar, you need to create the balance in the desired currency via a [gateway](https://github.com/stellar/docs/blob/master/docs/Introduction-Gateways.md). 
* Here's [a list of gateways](gateway-list.md) issuing credit on the Stellar network, and they offer different ways of depositing money in various currencies.
* Adding a gateway also extends trust lines to it. 
* The client will display your available balances on the added gateway.
