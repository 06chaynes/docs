Stellar Docs
============

This repository will turn into a source of a lot of Stellar documentation.

## docs
The docs folder contains a bunch of guides intended to be read by developers. These docs may occasionally contain API call snippets.

## api-docs
The api-docs currently contains docs that are used on https://www.stellar.org/api/

It will be refactored someday to use markdown and be human readable.

## Contributing
Contributers are welcome here. To contribute, create a new branch and then submit a pull request when you're done. Someone on the team will then review it and comment on it and/or pull in the changes.
